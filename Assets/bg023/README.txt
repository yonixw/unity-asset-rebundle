Need to allow read/write in Importer->Advanced
Nedd also to choose compression None

Crashes the game... but maybe because we need to use the exact Unity version? not 2022.3.7f1
  YES! same version works! only problem left is how to export the png since the Texture is read only... so 3rd party extractors only?
